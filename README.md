Project Title: Car Sales Insights and Performance Analysis


Project Overview:
This project involves the analysis of car sales data to provide comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and market trends. Using Power BI as the primary tool for data visualization and business intelligence, this project presents an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore key metrics related to car sales, customer demographics, and financial performance.


Key Objectives:
Sales Performance Analysis:
Identify sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly performance.
Highlight the best-selling car models, brands, and dealerships.
Track revenue and profit margins for different car segments.

Customer Demographics:
Analyze customer profiles, including age, location, and gender.
Understand the purchasing preferences and behavior of different customer groups.

Geographic Distribution:
Visualize sales performance by region, state, or city.
Identify potential markets for expansion or underperforming regions needing attention.

Sales Forecasting:
Implement data-driven forecasts to predict future sales trends.
Use historical data to create predictive models for better inventory and resource management.

Data Sources:
Sales Data: This includes details of sales transactions such as date, car model, dealership, sale price, and discount offered.
Customer Data: Customer demographics, such as age, gender, location, and purchase history, are used to segment and analyze consumer behavior.
Product Data: Specifications of cars (make, model, year, engine type) and their corresponding price and profit margins.
